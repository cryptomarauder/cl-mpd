;;; TODO
;;; Write the client side songid database using a hash-table with songid as the
;;; key.  Consider using an object to hold the table, and make the updater
;;; function the primary method.
;;;
;;; I don't think MPD keeps track of songs by songid outside of the current
;;; playlist.  Need to find out if I'm wrong, and perhaps consider adding that
;;; code to MPD itself.

;;; TODO
;;; Rewrite maphash to make traversal 'in' numerical order, which on lispworks
;;; is not. Although I am not so sure this is even worth tinkering with
;;; considering the dynamic nature of hash table keys.  Although I really would
;;; like to know why if you add entries into a hash table in numerical order,
;;; say 1 through 100, why then would they not be placed in that order, and
;;; specifically why this really is only an issue with lispworks.
;;;
;;; TODO
;;; How do I make it so that I can pass a function, such as
;;; MPD-SEND-NEXT-COMMAND, when such a function requires an iostream?
